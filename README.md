# Elementary Mathematical Modelling

## Introduction
This contains series of mathematical modelling projects. These projects are based on UBC MATH 360: Introduction to Mathematical Modelling. There're mainly 3 groups of math models: deterministic models (use differential equations to model the change with respect to time), stochastic models (randomness included), and data driven models (use linear regression and logistic regression on large datasets).

## Groups of Models
1. Deterministic Models: Temperature of the Earth and Atmosphere, Salinity.
2. Stochastic Models: Revenue of Pumpkin Shop, Revenue of Ice-cream Shop.
3. Data Driven Models: Strength of Concrete (Linear Regression), Card Fraud (Logistic Regression).
